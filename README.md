# Captcha-Processing
Cropping and extracting images of letters in captcha using OpenCV in Python.
The Cropped and extracted images can be further processed through a CNN classifier to give Captcha outputs as strings. However the jupyter notebook only contains code for extracting individual letters in captcha images using Contour Detection and Cropping with OpenCV in Python.
